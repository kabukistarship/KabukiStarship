## Project Roadmap

Each project has a set of milestones that you find by navigating to the GitHub repo issues for that project, then clicking on the Milestones right next to the "New Issue" button.

### Phase 1: Get Script2 English Language dictionary working

The thing we need in order to fit Wikipedia into the RAM on a computer are the Contiguous Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types and the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs). This will allow us to encode the rest of the works in Wikipedia.

### Phase 2: Get IGeekTileWorld, IGeekCarsWorld and IGeeekCarWorld working

CardsWorld is almost working to play Blackjack but there is no poker. We need to create an interface that allows for the AI to function the same in both CarWorld and CardsWorld.

### Phase 3: Get WikiSpy and IGeekWikiWorld working

We need to fit all of Wikipedia into the RAM on a computer so we can use it to train up some Artificial generalized intelligence using all of the knowledge of man kind. WikiSpy is a tool for monitoring Wiki-like sites for misinformation, tampering, and political bias. To reach this phase we will be able to detect political bias and tempering on Wikipedia, and limited abilities to spot misinformation.

### Phase 4: Get IGeekSpaceWorld working

We need to start creating some space ships so we're going to create a space environment for IGeek.
